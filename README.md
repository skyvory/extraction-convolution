# Extraction Convolution

Collection of intermediary batch tool for visual novel resources extraction I have used personally.

## GUI - Extraction Front

Extraction Front currently provides an app executable for easier common use.

Available tool pages:

- Versatile Single Switch

Provides simplification of batch extraction with whatever extraction tool that takes one parameter (usually the resource file) as input to generate its human readable media (images, sounds, videos, texts), where normally such tool would require cumbersome efforts to extract hundreds or even thousands of file because of their single-file-only process.

For such tool, by using this GUI-supported intermediary batch extractor, you can choose executables (.exe) for resource processing, assign resource file format to process, and directory of the resource files.

Note that for tools/executables that require more than just one resource file, the result would be guaranteed not according to what expected, or at worse crash the application.

### *Extraction Front hasn't been tested as the developer hasn't had spare time to assure app works seamlessly. Feel free to report problem.*
